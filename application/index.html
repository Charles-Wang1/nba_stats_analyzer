				This project uses a dataset found on Kaggle that contains every NBA player stats by game from 1950 to 2018. These basic stats serve as valuable information to both teams and fans. From a team perspective, every decision from trading players to designing a training schedule is influenced by these stats. From a fan perspective, the ability to compare and contrast different teams and players is very interesting. We wanted to find a way to filter and analyze this dataset in a useful manner. Thus, our application aims to deliver a user friendly search engine for player stats in many different ways for a thorough analysis.
